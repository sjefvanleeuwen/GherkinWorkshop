# Part 5: Advanced Gherkin Techniques

**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Objective:** Introduce participants to advanced Gherkin features, such as Data Tables, Backgrounds, and Scenario Outlines, to enhance the flexibility and reusability of their UAT scenarios.

---

### 5.1 Introduction to Advanced Gherkin Techniques (3 mins)
- **Objective:** Provide a brief overview of advanced Gherkin techniques that can help write more comprehensive and flexible scenarios.

#### Key Advanced Techniques:
1. **Data Tables:** Useful for scenarios where multiple data sets are needed.
2. **Backgrounds:** Ideal for common setup steps that apply to multiple scenarios.
3. **Scenario Outlines:** Allows testing of multiple data variations in a single scenario structure.

### 5.2 Demonstration of Each Advanced Technique (10 mins)
- **Objective:** Demonstrate each technique with a clear example so participants understand when and how to use them.

#### Technique 1: Data Tables (3 mins)
- **Use Case:** Testing multiple inputs or outputs in a single scenario.
- **Example:**
  - **Scenario:** Test a login feature with multiple user roles.
  - **Gherkin with Data Table:**
    ```gherkin
    Scenario: User login with different roles
      Given the user is on the login page
      When the user logs in with the following credentials:
        | username  | password | role       |
        | user1     | pass123  | regular    |
        | adminUser | pass456  | admin      |
        | guestUser | pass789  | guest      |
      Then the user should see their dashboard
    ```
  - **Explanation:** Each row in the table represents a different set of login data, allowing us to test multiple user types in one scenario.

#### Technique 2: Background (3 mins)
- **Use Case:** Common setup steps across multiple scenarios within a feature file.
- **Example:**
  - **Scenario:** Steps required before performing specific actions (e.g., logging in before accessing pages).
  - **Gherkin with Background:**
    ```gherkin
    Feature: Dashboard access
      Background:
        Given the user is logged in

      Scenario: User views dashboard
        When the user navigates to the dashboard page
        Then the user should see the dashboard content

      Scenario: User views account settings
        When the user navigates to the settings page
        Then the user should see the account settings options
    ```
  - **Explanation:** The `Background` section runs before each scenario, reducing repetition of the login step.

#### Technique 3: Scenario Outline (4 mins)
- **Use Case:** Scenarios with repeated steps but different data inputs.
- **Example:**
  - **Scenario:** Test a search function with various inputs.
  - **Gherkin with Scenario Outline:**
    ```gherkin
    Scenario Outline: Search for products
      Given the user is on the search page
      When the user searches for "<product>"
      Then the results should display items related to "<product>"

      Examples:
        | product    |
        | laptop     |
        | smartphone |
        | tablet     |
    ```
  - **Explanation:** The `Scenario Outline` runs the scenario for each item in the `Examples` table, allowing us to test different search terms efficiently.

### 5.3 Hands-On Exercise: Applying Advanced Techniques (7 mins)
- **Objective:** Allow participants to practice using advanced Gherkin techniques by enhancing their existing scenarios.

#### Instructions:
1. **Choose a Technique:** Ask each participant (or group) to select one of their previously written scenarios and enhance it with one of the advanced techniques:
   - Use a **Data Table** to test multiple inputs.
   - Add a **Background** section if the scenario has setup steps that are common to other scenarios.
   - Create a **Scenario Outline** to test variations in user actions or data.

2. **Independent or Group Work:** Give participants time to modify their scenario independently or in their groups, applying one advanced technique to see how it changes the structure.

3. **Optional Sharing:** If time permits, ask a few participants to share their enhanced scenarios with the group.

### 5.4 Q&A and Recap of Advanced Techniques (2 mins)
- **Objective:** Answer any questions and reinforce the purpose of each advanced technique.

#### Q&A:
- **Encourage Questions:** Allow participants to ask about the techniques or specific cases in which they might use each one.
- **Summary Points:**
  - **Data Tables:** Useful for multiple data inputs in one scenario.
  - **Backgrounds:** Helpful for setup steps shared across scenarios.
  - **Scenario Outlines:** Ideal for testing variations in a single scenario structure.

**Summary of Part 5:**  
This segment equips participants with tools to write more flexible, reusable Gherkin scenarios using advanced techniques, preparing them for complex UAT requirements.
