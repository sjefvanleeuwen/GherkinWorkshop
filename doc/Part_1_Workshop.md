# Part 1: Introduction & Current State

**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Objective:** Identify current challenges in managing business scenarios and set goals for standardizing UAT scenarios with Gherkin.

---

### 1.1 Opening Remarks (2 mins)
- **Facilitator Introduction:** Briefly introduce yourself and the purpose of today’s workshop.
- **Workshop Objective:** Explain that the goal is to equip Business Analysts (BAs) and Testers with the skills to create clear, centralized User Acceptance Test (UAT) scenarios using Gherkin.
- **Context Setting:** Describe why the team is moving towards standardization and how Gherkin will support collaboration and clarity.

### 1.2 Discussing Current State Challenges (5 mins)
- **Objective:** Highlight existing pain points in managing UAT scenarios.
  
#### Discussion Prompt:
- Ask participants to think about current challenges they face with UAT documentation and scenario management. For example:
  - **Fragmented Documentation:** Scenarios scattered across Excel, Word docs, or other formats.
  - **Inconsistencies in Language and Format:** Different styles or terminology used, leading to misinterpretations.
  - **Limited Traceability and Reuse:** Difficulty in tracking scenarios across projects or reusing scenarios in future cycles.
  - **Lack of a Centralized System:** No single, shared location for all scenarios, making it hard to collaborate or find relevant scenarios.

#### Activity:
- **Ask Participants to Share:** Ask a few participants to briefly describe one or two specific issues they face. This could include:
  - Confusion or delays due to scattered documentation.
  - Issues with unclear or redundant test scenarios.
  - Difficulty ensuring scenarios align with the user’s perspective.
- **Facilitator Summarizes Key Points:** Capture a few notes on a whiteboard or shared document to reflect common themes in challenges.

### 1.3 Setting Workshop Goals (3 mins)
- **Objective:** Define clear, shared goals for the workshop and future Gherkin use.

#### Presentation:
- Explain the three main goals of today’s workshop:
  1. **Clarity and Consistency:** Create a standard way of writing UAT scenarios to ensure clarity across teams.
  2. **Centralized Specification Language:** Use Gherkin syntax to standardize scenarios in a way that’s easy to read and maintain.
  3. **Improved Collaboration:** Make it easier for BAs, Testers, and Developers to align on requirements and expected behaviors.

#### Facilitator Prompt:
- **Ask for Input:** Invite participants to add any additional goals or expectations they may have for this workshop.

**Summary of Part 1:**  
In this segment, participants will recognize shared challenges, which will set the stage for a strong case for centralizing UAT scenarios. With these goals defined, we move into the "Why a Centralized Language Specification?" part, where Gherkin will be introduced as a solution to these common issues.
